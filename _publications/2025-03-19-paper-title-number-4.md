To address the off-site attack, especially the potential attackers who may be malicious merchants, we also propose SALP, a secure and authenticated payment protocol, using time and position as necessary conditions for the payment confirmation. Furthermore, we leverage identity-based signature (IBS) to prevent altering the information and reduce the overhead of the third-party authentication. We conduct case studies to demonstrate that the SALP can effectively prevent the off-site payment attack without a trusted hardware environment. In particular, we finally argue that SALP does not bring additional system overhead without degrading the convenience of mobile payment.
