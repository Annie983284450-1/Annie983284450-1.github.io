In this paper, we propose an online privacy-preserving IDR management system, in which social welfare is maximized through recommending the optimal consumer to the utility company. Since the contexts of electricity curtailment offers from the utility company are different, an adaptive context partition method is proposed to enable the system context awareness. In addition, we cluster the customers in a tree structure to make the analyses of the customers in the cluster level and thus enable the algorithm to support the large-scale system. Furthermore, a tree-based noise aggregation method is applied to guarantee both the differential privacy of customer sensitive information and the utility of the data. Theoretical analysis shows that our proposal guarantees differential privacy of customers, while converging to the optimal policy in a long run. Numerical results validate that our proposed algorithm supports the large-scale dataset while striking a balance between the privacy-preserving level and social welfare.
