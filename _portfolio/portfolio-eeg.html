During visual processing, the brain communicates through
tangled network connections and compounded signal structures.
However, we know that it is a trivial and quick task to recall the name
of our favorite actors. To explain how the brain can pull off almost
instantaneous face classification and to build off previous work in
dimensionality reduction in the brain, we aim to model the brainâ€™s
processing system in terms of optimized hardware and signals. Using
methods including PCA we explore how the whole brain responds to
complexity and how the frequency patterns of brain waves may adjust
to complexity. We demonstrate that whole-brain responses to faces
may increase in complexity with increased stimulus complexity. Next,
we show that different types of images may be processed by distinct
signal frequencies. Finally using a deep learning approach, we
determined the regions of the outer cortex that are most important to
face classification include the occipital and temporal cortex. 

<!-- 
Our first goal was to investigate how the whole brain response relates to stimulus complexity. To do this, we applied PCA to trial-averaged functional EEG data in response to different classes of visual stimuli. We found that the PCs for familiar, unfamiliar, and scrambled faces shared some overlap. Overall this suggests that cortex wide processing of visual information is capable of expressing a finite repertoire of principal components and that a subset of those components is employed for any given stimulus. We note that even though the EEG responses to different stimuli occupy some similar dimensions, this does not imply that the responses activate the same regions of the PC subspace. The activity we measure may covary along the same dimensions but be centered at different locations in the functional EEG space. Future work can look into whether this activity is centered in the brain.

Our second goal was to understand the frequency patterns that V1 uses to process images of varying complexities. We performed this analysis by separating frequencies into smaller bands rather than individual components or features to create a simple and interpretable model. From our band-level analysis, we found little overlap between the frequency pattern components of different stimuli responses. However, in comparison to the trends seen in Fig. 3c, the dimensions for image combinations increased similarly to the combinations of the responses they invoke. Perhaps the number of frequency components used to explain an image scale up with image complexity. In the future, this could be further studied by decomposing the signal into more basic frequency components using a wavelet transform method. -->

From our model and ranked features we noted that the top 20 channels needed for feature classification come from V1. This suggests the stimulus-driven patterns are best discerned in V1 and not in other areas along the visual pathway. For future work, it would be interesting to connect the results from the whole-brain PCA to see what specific regions are similar/different for the varying stimuli.

The basic LSTM model, though a basic version, then ran for 4 folds over the 16 subjects in the datasets, gives an overall accuracy of 34.7%. On the other hand, the MALSTM-FCN model which improves on the basic LSTM module achieves an overall performance of 69.4% over the same dataset
