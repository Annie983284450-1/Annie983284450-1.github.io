We employ different ways to understand the data and generate features, such as word clouds, n-gram analysis, topic modeling techniques like LDA and sentiment analysis, TF-IDF. Different feature extraction approaches, such as word clouds, n-gram analysis, topic modeling techniques like LDA and sentiment analysis could be adopted to provide a thorough understanding of the dataset. We model the data with unsupervised ML techniques (e.g., KMeans/GMM clustering, SVD-based Latent Semantic Analysis), as well as supervised techniques like Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, SVM, kNN .etc. In addition to learning, we also explore various feature selection techniques, TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) normalization, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) for dimensionality reduction. We compare the performance of these techniques using the performance metrics such as confusion matrix, F-score, etc., and finally, audit them with interpretable ML tools such as SHAP and LIME to explain how the model works.
