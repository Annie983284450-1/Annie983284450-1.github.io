[Project Code](https://github.com/Annie983284450-1/Fine-Tuning-LLMs)

- Developed and implemented advanced NLP models by fine-tuning large language models (Flan-T5, DistilBERT) for various tasks, including text summarization, sentiment analysis, translation, and question answering.
- Employed Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique to efficiently fine-tune transformer models, significantly reducing computational overhead and training time.
- Integrated transfer learning and prompt-engineering methodologies, demonstrating improved performance on benchmark datasets such as SST-2 and SQuAD v2.
- Built interactive chatbot prototypes using custom fine-tuned models to enhance conversational accuracy and fluency.
